Can be acclimated to nearly direct sunlight in the right conditions, but philodendron thrive in light shade. If you notice many of the leaves turning yellow at the same time, it can indicate you are giving the plant too much direct light. If you notice it is getting leggy, it may need more light. Keep soil moist at all times.",
